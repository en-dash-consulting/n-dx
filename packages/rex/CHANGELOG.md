## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add Asana as a work-tracking integration target. A new built-in `asana` store adapter syncs the PRD tree to tasks in an Asana project: `rex adapter add asana --token=<pat> --projectId=<gid>` configures the connection (token redacted to `REX_ASANA_TOKEN`), and `rex sync --adapter=asana` creates/updates Asana tasks through the existing `SyncEngine`, which reports per-item results. The PRD hierarchy maps onto Asana subtasks; each task's native `external` field carries the PRD item id plus level/status/priority and other PRD-only metadata, so rex-managed tasks round-trip faithfully while tasks authored in the Asana UI degrade gracefully (level inferred by depth, status from the completed flag). Kept separate from the Notion, Jira, and GitHub Projects integrations. Adds an `asana` integration schema for the web UI and folds the duplicated built-in-adapter name list into an exported `BUILT_IN_NAMES` set.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add GitHub Projects as a work-tracking integration target. A new built-in `github` store adapter syncs the PRD tree to a GitHub Projects (v2) board: `rex adapter add github --token=<pat> --projectId=<PVT_...>` configures the connection (token redacted to `REX_GITHUB_TOKEN`), and `rex sync --adapter=github` creates/updates project draft issues through the existing `SyncEngine`, which reports per-item results. GitHub Projects v2 is a flat collection with no `external` field or native hierarchy, so each PRD item is stored as a draft issue whose body carries the human-readable description + acceptance criteria plus a hidden `<!-- n-dx-meta: {json} -->` footer holding the PRD id, parent id, level, status, priority and other PRD-only metadata; the tree is reconstructed from the footer's parent id. Draft issues authored in the GitHub UI degrade gracefully. The adapter talks to the GitHub GraphQL API via `fetch` (no new dependency). Adds a `github` integration schema for the web UI. Kept separate from the Notion, Jira, and Asana integrations.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add Jira as a work-tracking integration target. The existing `jira` integration schema (previously a UI-only stub) is now backed by a built-in `jira` store adapter that syncs the PRD tree to Jira issues: `rex adapter add jira --domain=<host> --email=<email> --apiToken=<token> --projectKey=<KEY>` configures the connection (API token redacted to `REX_JIRA_API_TOKEN`), and `rex sync --adapter=jira` creates/updates issues through the existing `SyncEngine`, which reports per-item results. Each PRD item maps to a Jira issue of the configured type (default "Task"); summary ↔ title, description + acceptance criteria render into the issue description (converted to Atlassian Document Format by the client), and the PRD id, parent id, level, status, priority and other PRD-only metadata are carried in a hidden `<!-- n-dx-meta: {json} -->` footer so the tree round-trips. When label sync is enabled, PRD tags are also written to Jira labels (sanitized). The client talks to the Jira Cloud REST API v3 via `fetch` with Basic auth (no new dependency). Kept separate from the Notion, Asana, and GitHub Projects integrations.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add a common PRD-to-work-item linkage model. `PRDItem` now carries an optional structured `links` array (`WorkItemLink`), the system-agnostic surface every work-tracking integration (Notion, Jira, GitHub Projects, Asana, …) uses to record the relationship between a PRD requirement and its downstream work item — link identity is `(system, workItemId)`. A new `core/work-item-link.ts` module exposes pure, immutable operations — `getLinks`, `findLink`, `upsertLink`, `removeLink`, `updateLinkSyncState` — so a linkage is stored when a work item is created (`upsertLink`) and reflects the latest known remote state (`updateLinkSyncState` patches `syncState`/`remoteStatus`/`lastSyncedAt`/`error`). Links round-trip through the folder-tree serializer/parser (object-array frontmatter, like `commits`) with no storage changes, so they are visible whenever the PRD is loaded. Validated by `WorkItemLinkSchema` (strict). The pre-existing single `remoteId` sync field is left untouched for backward compatibility.

### Patch Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/206) [`d278f05`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d278f0506c94ae8bce068f770caa450e07a3330e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Rework the PRD context graph, harden the hench run loop, and add LLM auto-failover.

  **PRD context graph (web)** — Top-down progressive-disclosure layout with folder-tree
  visual style; shape-based nodes for epic/feature/task/subtask; click-through opens the
  Rex task detail panel with subtree highlighting. Hierarchy is now driven from
  `.rex/prd_tree/` paths.

  **Hench run loop** — Per-task attempt tracking, completed tasks excluded from
  selection, and the loop advances immediately on success. The `no-plan-mode` rule is
  embedded in the agent system prompt; autonomous runs (`--auto` / `--loop` /
  `--epic-by-epic`) default to `acceptEdits`. New
  `docs/contributing/run-loop-invariants.md`.

  **LLM auto-failover** — New `llm.autoFailover` flag with vendor-specific failover
  chains; `hench run` restores the original config after a failover attempt. Model
  resolution honours top-level `llm.model` → `llm.{vendor}.model` → tier default.

  **Rex storage** — PRD tree rewritten to canonical `index.md`-per-folder layout with
  single-child compaction and atomic leaf-to-folder promotion for subtasks. Timestamped
  snapshots before structural migrations; cross-PRD duplicate detection in `reshape`.

  **CLI / DX** — New `ndx tree` command and tree-formatted `rex status`; `ndx self-heal`
  gains a pre-execution approval gate with `selfHeal.autoConfirm`. Obfuscated-code commit
  blocker added.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Allow partial accept inside a recommendation group via
  `rex recommend --accept=hashes:<hash>,<hash>,…`. Findings matching the listed
  hash prefixes are filtered first; the recommendation tree is regenerated from
  just those findings and accepted whole. Lets you keep the one valid finding
  inside a noisy group without forcing acks on the rest or having to take the
  group all-or-nothing.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Make `rex recommend` acknowledgement workflow address-by-hash. Each finding
  now prints with a stable 6-char hash prefix (`[a3f5d8]`) and
  `--acknowledge=<hash|index>,…` accepts either. Hashes are recommended because
  indices renumber after every ack — a planned `--acknowledge=1,5,9` no longer
  goes wrong when the first ack shifts the list.

  Adds `--unacknowledge=<hash|index>,…` to undo prior acknowledgements
  (previously required hand-editing `.rex/acknowledged-findings.json`) and
  `--reason=<category>` to capture _why_ — canonical categories are
  `tool-artifact`, `already-done`, `doesnt-apply`, `over-engineered`,
  `speculative`, and free-form values are also accepted. The recorded reason
  will later let the analyzer mine repeated junk and improve its prompts.

- [#216](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/216) [`29bd146`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/29bd14608135ee9b0ae1168f77226113436da67a) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Smart-add fixes — nesting, dashboard Quick Add, and clearer errors.

  **Nesting (rex):** `n-dx add` no longer creates a duplicate epic when the work
  belongs under an existing one. The LLM was supposed to set `existingId` for
  placement under an existing epic/feature but often omitted it. Added a
  deterministic post-generation pass that matches proposed epics/features
  against existing PRD containers (high-confidence, title-based) and fills
  `existingId` so the new task nests instead of duplicating. Respects an
  `existingId` the LLM already set; skipped when an explicit `--parent` is
  given.

  **Dashboard Quick Add latency (rex + web):** new `--fast` flag for `rex add`
  forces the vendor's light tier (haiku for Claude, gpt-5.4-mini for Codex) so
  the CLI provider completes well within the timeout from a daemonized server.
  The web Quick Add preview now passes `--fast`; the user-driven CLI
  `n-dx add` is unchanged.

  **Timeout error message (web):** the smart-add timeout no longer wrongly
  implies "set an API key" is the fix — the Claude CLI provider is a valid
  first-class path. The message now points at the right diagnostic
  (`time claude -p`), notes an API key is only an optional speed-up, and
  appends captured stderr when present.

### Minor Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/198) [`4de9d46`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4de9d46036963129b0e962e1c9aed7e0b9d87262) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Address security findings, fix package publishing regression, and refresh documentation.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

  - Classify changes in run summary (code/test/docs/config/metadata-only)

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Default to showing all PRD items (fixes blank page for 100% complete projects)
  - Remove redundant StatusFilter, wire status chips to tree visibility
  - Smart collapse: tree starts closed when no active work
  - Hide view-header, promote breadcrumb as page title
  - Show sibling page icons in collapsed sidebar rail
  - Move command buttons (Add, Prune) inline into search row
  - Add filtered-empty state messaging

  ### CLI

  - Surface all package commands through `ndx` (validate, fix, health, report, verify, update, remove, move, reshape, reorganize, prune, next, reset, show)
  - Helpful error when running orchestrator commands on package CLIs
  - Workflow-based `ndx --help` grouping (no package names in primary help)
  - Skip provider prompt on re-init when config exists
  - Unified init status report
  - Branded ASCII art CLI header

  ### Docs

  - New 5-minute quickstart tutorial
  - New troubleshooting guide (7 common issues)
  - Commands reference rewritten by workflow stage

  ### Infrastructure

  - `@n-dx/core` included in release workflow (synced version + auto-publish)
  - `/ndx-reshape` skill for PRD hierarchy restructuring
  - `/ndx-capture` skill updated with automatic parent placement and dependency wiring

- [#109](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/109) [`9c2963f`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/9c2963fcb95e9e80c4702878c958f486bf5f9fbb) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### SourceVision

  - **Zone stability:** Louvain community detection now seeds from previous zone assignments, preserving topology across runs. Files stay in their previous zones unless import structure genuinely shifts.
  - **Zone identity preservation:** Zones with >50% file overlap with a previous zone inherit its ID and name, preventing the LLM from inventing new names each run.
  - **Stability bias:** Synthetic co-zone edges reinforce previous zone membership during Louvain optimization. Configurable weight (default 0.5x median import edge).
  - **Stability reporting:** New `stability` field in zones.json tracks file retention, persisted/new/removed zones, and reassigned files between runs.
  - **Finding category taxonomy:** Findings now carry a `category` field (`structural`, `code`, `documentation`) enabling downstream filtering. LLM prompts request categories; regex heuristic classifies when LLM doesn't provide one.
  - **Finding staleness validation:** Findings referencing deleted/moved files are automatically skipped during `rex recommend`.
  - **Weighted cohesion metrics:** Project-wide averages weighted by zone file count. Zones with <5 files excluded from aggregates (unreliable metrics). Both weighted and unweighted averages reported.
  - **Small-zone merge logging:** Configurable merge threshold with debuggability logging.
  - **Git SHA refresh:** `manifest.gitSha` now updated at analysis start, not just init time.

  ### Rex

  - **Self-heal: exclude structural findings:** `--exclude-structural` flag on `rex recommend` skips zone boundary opinions. Self-heal loop passes it by default.
  - **Self-heal: file-level regression guard:** Progress signals shifted from zone-relative (weighted cohesion) to zone-independent metrics (circular deps, code findings, unused exports).
  - **Zone pin discoverability:** `ndx analyze` suggests zone pins when structural findings detected. `ndx config --help` documents `sourcevision.zones.pins`. `rex recommend` shows pin tip for structural findings.
  - **Workflow split:** Base n-dx workflow in `n-dx_workflow.md` (always updated on init) + user customizations in `workflow.md` (preserved across re-init). Prohibited changes section prevents lint-suppress-only commits.
  - **Stats fix:** Childless features now counted in `get_prd_status` totals.
  - **Config routing:** `sourcevision.*` config keys now route to `.n-dx.json` for zone pin management.

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Zone slideout shows "pinned" badge on files with zone pin overrides.
  - Server augments `/api/sv/zones` response with zone pins from `.n-dx.json`.

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use bash wrapper script for changeset version command (changesets/action splits on whitespace without a shell).

- [#99](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/99) [`17e486a`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/17e486a391d85a65e62d231539bff0a2ee212dc8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### Rex

  - Proactive PRD structure health checks with configurable thresholds
  - Post-write health warnings on `rex add` and `rex analyze`
  - Structure health gate in `ndx ci` (fails below score 50)

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Checkbox multi-select: hover reveals checkbox, click row opens detail panel
  - Remove Edit icon from tree rows (detail panel handles editing)
  - Completion timeline view with date range filters (today/week/month/all)

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use `npx` for changeset commands (pnpm script resolution bug)
