Dashboard jobs that write `.sourcevision/` — analysis (quick, targeted, and full), refresh, and CI — now share one write lock: starting any of them while another runs returns 409 naming the in-flight job, instead of letting two writers corrupt the analysis output. The previously unguarded quick-analysis path is covered too.
