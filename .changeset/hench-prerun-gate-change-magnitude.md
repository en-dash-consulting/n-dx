Make the hench pre-run commit gate size-aware with configurable thresholds.

The gate now measures change magnitude (dirty file count plus lines changed vs HEAD via `git diff --numstat`, shared helper `measureChangeMagnitude`) instead of reacting only to a non-empty dirty list. Two new persisted settings under `hench.git.*` (`.hench/config.json`, editable via `ndx config`):

- **`hench.git.checkpointThreshold`** (default: 200, 0 disables) — at/above this many changed lines, the interactive prompt warns about the change size and defaults to committing a checkpoint instead of proceeding. Below the threshold, behavior is unchanged.
- **`hench.git.requireCleanTree`** (default: false) — refuse to start against a dirty tree: the interactive prompt drops the "proceed" option and non-interactive runs (`--yes`, piped) abort.

Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) keep today's behavior — abort on any dirty tree unless `--allow-dirty` — but the refusal now reports the measured magnitude. `--allow-dirty` takes precedence over both config settings for a single run (flag > config > defaults). Documented in `hench run --help` and `ndx config --help`.
