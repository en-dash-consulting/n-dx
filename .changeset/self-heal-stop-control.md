Self-heal can be stopped from the dashboard. The web server exposes `POST /api/commands/self-heal/stop`, which kills the managed loop process (SIGTERM) and reports it as stopped rather than failed. The Self-Heal panel shows the current iteration and phase parsed from loop output, with a Stop button while it runs.
