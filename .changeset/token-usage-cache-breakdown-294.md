fix(token-usage): report actual token usage broken out by type (input/output/cache-write/cache-read), consistently in rollup and dashboard (#294)

The per-item rollup summed cache tokens into a single conflated total (~23M for a run whose real work was ~40K), while the dashboard Usage page counted only input+output — a ~575× divergence for the same runs. Rather than pick one number, both surfaces now report the actual usage broken out by type, with no cost/pricing math.

- **rex:** `ItemTokenTuple` now carries `input`, `output`, `cacheCreation`, `cacheRead`, and `total` (= their sum). `tokensFromRecord`, self/descendant attribution, and the ancestor roll-up track all four components; `get_token_usage` surfaces the breakdown.
- **web:** the Usage-page extractor reads `cacheCreationInput`/`cacheReadInput` from run records (previously dropped), surfacing cache-write and cache-read as distinct fields and attributing run-level cache totals without double-counting across turns. `incremental-task-usage` uses the same breakdown, so the dashboard and rollup report identical numbers for the same runs.
