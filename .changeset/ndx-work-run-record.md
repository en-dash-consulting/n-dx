Record `/ndx-work` task execution in hench run history (#271). The `/ndx-work` skill drove tasks through Claude Code without spawning hench, so the work left no `.hench/runs/` entry and was invisible to run history and `ndx usage`. A new `hench record` command writes a lightweight run record (task id, title, status, summary, timestamps, model) marked `assisted`, and the skill now calls it as a final step. Because Claude Code does not expose its own token consumption to a running skill, assisted records carry empty token usage and an `assisted` flag so analytics can distinguish them from genuine hench runs rather than reading them as anomalies; the skill also surfaces this caveat to the user.
