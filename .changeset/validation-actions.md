The Validation view gains repair, verification, and restructuring actions: Fix issues (`rex fix`, dry-run preview then apply, followed by automatic re-validation), Run CI check (`ndx ci`, async with structured JSON results), and Reshape PRD (`rex reshape`, previews proposals and applies only on explicit confirm). Backed by new /api/commands/{fix,ci,reshape} endpoints.
