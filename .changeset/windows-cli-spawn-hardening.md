Harden CLI spawning on Windows so launching `.cmd` shims (claude, codex, rex) no longer fails. Node can't spawn a `.cmd` directly (post-CVE-2024-27980), and the previous `shell: process.platform === "win32"` workaround triggered the `[DEP0190]` deprecation and broke on paths containing spaces.

- **New `spawnCli` helper** (`@n-dx/llm-client`) routes CLI binaries through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` and never uses `shell:true`. Argument quoting follows the Microsoft ArgvQuote / cross-spawn rules (unconditional quoting, backslash-run doubling before quotes, embedded-quote doubling) so paths with spaces and tokens with cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | < > ^ ( )`) are handled. The orchestration tier (`@n-dx/core`) carries an equivalent `win-spawn.js` twin (it cannot import `@n-dx/llm-client`), kept in lockstep by a cross-package parity test.
- **All CLI-binary spawn sites** are routed through the helper: the claude and codex providers, the hench agent loop and its adapters, the `ndx config` CLI-path validator, `ndx pair-programming`'s reviewer, and sourcevision's `rex` invocations.
- **Prompts are delivered via stdin** for the codex hench adapter and the pair-programming reviewer (previously passed as an argv token), preventing multi-line prompt truncation and command injection through `cmd.exe`.
- **`diagnoseCliInvocation`** produces an actionable message when a CLI binary is missing or not invokable — distinguishing a not-found binary, a configured absolute path that doesn't exist, and a binary present on PATH but failing to run — and works from the close/non-zero-exit path on Windows (where a missing `.cmd` never raises `ENOENT`). Detection is anchored to the spawned binary so a legitimate run's own error output isn't misclassified.
- A **regression guard test** fails CI if any CLI spawn site reintroduces the `shell:true` + args (`DEP0190`) pattern.

No behavior change on macOS or Linux.
