Make a command timeout actually stop the command, descendants included.

`exec` delegated its timeout to Node's `execFile`, which signals only the process it spawned. Anything that process had itself started survived — kept running, kept holding file handles, kept writing to the workspace — while the caller had already been told the command stopped. Measured on Windows with a 400ms timeout: the reported result was `Command timed out after 400ms`, yet the surviving process went on to write four more times, and a temp directory it held could not be removed for 52 seconds.

That report is what an autonomous agent acts on. It reads files and runs the next command believing the previous one finished, so a build or codemod still writing underneath it can corrupt the state being read.

`exec` now owns the timeout timer and terminates the whole process tree when it fires: a process-group signal on POSIX (`SIGTERM`, escalating to `SIGKILL`, waiting on the *group* rather than the direct child), and `taskkill /T /F` on Windows. `exitCode: null` still signals a timeout, and an externally-killed child still reports the same way it always did. Opt out with `treeKill: false` when a child must stay in the caller's own process group.

Not a Windows-only fix, though Windows is where it was caught: the orphan survived on POSIX too, just invisibly, because unlinking open files is permitted there so no EBUSY drew attention to it. On Windows, libuv's global job object masks the problem for node-spawned node, but not for the cases that matter — `sh`, `cmd`, `make`, and pnpm/npm shims all leave their children behind.

The primitive is exported as `terminateProcessTree` / `treeKillSpawnOptions`. It is a deliberate twin of `terminateTree` in `packages/core/child-lifecycle.js`, since the orchestration tier must not import from packages; a parity test fails if the two diverge.
